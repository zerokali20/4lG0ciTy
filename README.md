# 4lG0ciTy


4lGoCiTy is a comprehensive simulation that models city infrastructure management through advanced algorithmic concepts. Unlike standard library implementations, this project builds core data structures from scratch to solve realistic urban problems:

- Citizen Registry: High-performance record management using AVL Trees (self-balancing) vs. standard BSTs.

- Emergency Response: Priority-based event handling using Max-Heaps.

- Infrastructure Network: A Graph-based city map implementing Dijkstra’s Algorithm for GPS navigation and Prim’s Algorithm for optimizing power grid layout.

- Data Archival: File compression using Huffman Coding for efficient storage.

- Rapid Lookup: Custom Hash Table implementation with collision handling for instant building identification.

This project serves as a practical application of the entire Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms syllabus, bridging the gap between theoretical complexity analysis and real-world system design.
